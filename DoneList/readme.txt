Second, this app lets user to create multiple categories of their to do lists. Once user has created a category, the app proceeds to screen where users are allowed to add multiple items under the category. Each Item, just like each distinct category would show a unique color. At the end, based on the completion of the item under the category, user should be able to mark each item with a check mark that will be considered DONE. The app has Realm library ingrained to activate the persistence function. In future, the app can be enhanced for with a corporate version as many orgaizations use their own login mechanism to access the propriatery information. Each member of the organization has a seperate preference of a running checklist, that they would like to maintain.
